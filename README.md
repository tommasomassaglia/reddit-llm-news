Weekly reddit LLM news!

I want to develop a simple reddit scraper to get the most interesting news and discussions around llms/image generation/ai on a weekly basis. The bot would function this way:
1. Fetch the top/most interacted post from a specific subset of subreddit once every week
2. Add the fetched data to some sort of knowledge base for retrieval
3. Select the most interesting posts using some sort of filtering agent
The requests to the server would be minimal and the usage would mostly be for myself, as there are aggregators for X/linkedin on the topic but the discussion is much more interesting on Reddit.
